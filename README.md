# advanced-natural-language-processing
This course aims to introduce graduate students to the field of Natural Language Processing. The field studies various computer algorithms that enable the computers to understand and process human language such as Korean, English, Chinese, etc. In addition, as applications of NLP, this course introduces POS tagging, named entity recognition, translation, parsing, dialogue systems and etc. NLP is actually multidisciplinary. Thus, many basic ideas and algorithms of machine learning will be introduced as well as linguistics.
